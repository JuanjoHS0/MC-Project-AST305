# MC-Project-AST305

Code for the Monte Carlo project for the AST305 course, where we use this numerical method to compute the Kroupa (2002) IMF, and make simulations for 1e2 - 1e6 number of stars and see how the remnant masses distribute in the different types of remnant objects according to different mass limits given mainly by the Kalirai et al. (2008) and Raithel et al. (2018). 
A further explanation of the code is made in its corresponding section.
